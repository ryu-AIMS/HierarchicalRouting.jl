# MS-T_routing

Some description of what the code in this repo does.

## Setup

Go through the usual Julia project set up by instantiating the project.

```julia
]instantiate
```

## Project structure

Scripts are placed in the `src` directory.

Results of these scripts are currently outputted into `outputs`.

Data relevant to the analyses should be placed (somewhere...)
